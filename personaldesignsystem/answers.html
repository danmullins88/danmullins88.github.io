            <p>What's the one word you want people to feel when they come in contact with your work/you?<a href=""><span> Purposeful</span></a><br /><br /><br /><br />

            What do you value?<a href=""><span> Within design I have always found that minimalism and simplicity attracted my attention the most. I think that good design is minimal, modest and discreet. The best design pieces lack exaggeration and excess decoration, were the user is able to adapt the design piece to any environment. Non-essential waste in the design hinders its longevity into the future. Focussing on essential features, future generations will appreciate simplicity where less is more. Its timelessness keeps it in fashion for longer.</span></a><br /><br /><br /><br />

            How will you bring value to the world?<a href=""><span> Adding value isn’t just about my career of course, it is about my whole life. Value doesn’t automatically mean money, however, it could be a way I help people in the future. I can add value into the world through every relationship I have - every friend I help, every stranger I care about, every family member I support, every child I bring up, and every time I care about anyone else.</span></a><br /><br /><br /><br />

            How will you impact others in a positive way?<a href=""><span> Through design, interaction, and understanding, I can have such a positive impact on the way people live and on their relationships and moods.</span></a><br /><br /><br /><br />

            What are you passionate about?<a href=""><span> A couple of years before coming to the school I grew a passion about some of the problems our world faces today. I became interested in Climate Change, Pollution, and Immigration. I actually did my parsons challenge about each of these topics and have used them throughout my work in Parsons since, and at the moment I’m working on an idea for an app that will help with plastic recycling and cleanups. I’m also very interested in the psychology of human interactions.</span></a><br /><br /><br /><br />

            What are you skilled at doing?<a href=""><span> I have always enjoyed the challenge to solve problems using creativity. I’m mostly experienced in Photoshop, Indesign, and have worked on some small projects on Premiere. I’ve always struggled with coding, but I really want and need to become more skilled in it. </span></a><br /><br /><br /><br />

            How can you make money?<a href=""><span> I want to bring something new and beneficial to the people and the environment, and make money that way, but what that is right now, I don’t know. I feel as though I’ll be able to figure that out in due course.</span></a><br /><br /><br /><br />

            What companies would you love to work for?<a href=""><span> Well recently I’ve wanted to give NIKE a try for a year after I graduate. It’s a company I have always admired since I was growing up, and would really like to work on their marketing campaigns and strategies.</span></a><br /><br /><br /><br />

            What are some characteristics of your ideal workplace?<a href=""><span> Not corporate - I don’t like 9-5 everyday. I feel as though people loose focus a lot of the time and waste it on needless things while they could be doing something more productive elsewhere. I want it to be vibrant and energised, where everybody is valued. I like collaborative studios and the community feel in the workplace. Open spaces, lots of light, colour, and creative spaces with art pieces, sculptures - inspiration. 
</span></a><br /><br /><br /><br />

            What kind of work do you want to be doing?<a href=""><span> At the moment I really enjoy business, marketing, strategic thinking, and problem solving with design integrated within it, so something along those lines.</span></a><br /><br /><br /><br />
