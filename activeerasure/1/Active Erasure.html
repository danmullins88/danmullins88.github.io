	<center><h1>Mad Girl's Love Song</h1>
	<i><h2>By Sylvia Plath</h2></i></center>

	<br /><center><p class="firstthree">
 I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead;<br />
I lift my lids and all is born again.<br />
 I think I made you up inside my head.<br /><br />

The stars go waltzing out in blue and red,<br />
And arbitrary blackness gallops in:<br />
I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.<br /><br />

I dreamed that you bewitched me into bed<br />
And sung me moon-struck, kissed me quite insane.<br />
 I think I made you up inside my head.<br /><br />

God topples from the sky, hell's fires fade:<br />
Exit seraphim and Satan's men:<br />
I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.<br /><br />

I fancied you'd return the way you said,<br />
But I grow old and I forget your name.<br />
 I think I made you up inside my head.<br /><br />

I should have loved a thunderbird instead;<br />
At least when spring comes they roar back again.<br />
I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.<br />
 I think I made you up inside my head.<br /><br />
