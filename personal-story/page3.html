  <p align = "right">HOWEVER, AFTER SEEING EDINBURGH, I WAS EXTREMELY EXCITED TO MOVE, IT WAS JUST SO MUCH NICER AND CLEANER THAN MOSCOW WAS BACK THEN. MY DAD PUT ME INTO A BOARDING SCHOOL CALLED FETTES COLLEGE, WHICH APPARENTLY WAS J.K. ROWLINGS INSPIRATION FOR HOGWARTS IN THE HARRY POTTER FILMS. FOR A YEAR OR TWO I WAS SORT OF THE ODD ONE OUT, BECAUSE I DIDNT SPEAK ENGLISH AS FLUENTLY AS OTHERS AND DIDNT UNDERSTAND SPORTS SUCH AS CRICKET, HOCKEY, RUGBY.. ETC, ALL I KNEW WAS HOW TO PLAY FOOTBALL.<br />
