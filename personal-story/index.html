  <strong><p align = "right">I was born in Newcastle-Under-Lyme,<br /> 
  which is located within Stoke-On-Trent,<br /> 
and if nobody knows where that is --- it's right beside Manchester.<br /> 
I was always told that Robbie Williams was born in the exact same hospital and the exact same room, 
I only spent a year there, and then we left to live in Moscow.<br />
