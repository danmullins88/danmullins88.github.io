  <p align = "right">I WAS BORN IN NEWCASTLE-UNDER-LYME,<br /> 
  WHICH IS LOCATED BESIDE STOKE-ON-TRENT,<br /> 
AND IF NOBODY KNOWS WHERE THAT IS --- IT'S RIGHT BESIDE MANCHESTER.<br /> 
I WAS ALWAYS TOLD THAT ROBBIE WILLIAMS WAS BORN IN THE EXACT SAME HOSPITAL<br /> AND THE EXACT SAME ROOM, BUT NGL I NEVER BELIEVED THEM.<br /> 
I ONLY SPENT A YEAR THERE, AND THEN MOVED TO MOSCOW, RUSSIA.<br />
